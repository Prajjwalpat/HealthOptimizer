        <h1>Eating Fried Food Linked to Depression, Anxiety: Study</h1><br>

         <pre>   April 25, 2023 – People who frequently eat fried food, particularly potatoes like french fries, have a higher risk of anxiety or depression, according to a new study.

            Specifically, the results showed that frequent fried food consumption was linked to a 12% higher risk of anxiety and 7% higher risk of depression. Males and young people were impacted the most.
            
            The study, published Monday in the journal PNAS, was done by researchers from Zhejiang University in China. They evaluated data for more than 140,000 people during an 11-year period. 
            
            The authors suggested that one cause could be that fried foods contain a chemical called acrylamide, which arises when some foods are cooked at very high temperatures. The researchers noted that acrylamide is linked to “anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors” related to brain inflammation.
