        <h1>Raw vs Cooked</h1><br>

         <pre>   The debate between raw & cooked foods on its perceived benefits for health, is never ending. There are raw protagonists, for whom cooking is the worst thing that happened to humans. Then there are people, who are fine with either of them, which consists of most of the population.

Whenever we talk about raw foodies, they are the ones who majorly consume foods which are uncooked, unheated, and unprocessed. For someone to eat raw food diet, they should be consuming 70% of their foods in raw form.Foods like raw vegetables and fruits, nuts, seeds, fermented foods, sprouts, raw dairy etc. all come under the gamut of raw foods. Mostly, people who consume raw foods are vegetarians or vegans. But there are people who eat meat, fish and poultry, along with raw foods.

Acc. to the beliefs of raw foodies, in process of cooking, most nutrition is destroyed, and it also destroys the natural enzymes present in food, which overall makes the cooked food, toxic in nature.

But that’s not how things really work, when we study a subject scientifically. Both raw and cooked foods have their respective benefits, and it’s a combination of both, which gives you overall health benefits.

When it comes to cooking, evidence suggests that, humans adapted to a cooked diet at least 275,000 years ago.
